## Resume

**Languages:**
- French: Advanced (C1)
- English: Upper Intermediate (B2)

**Professional Summary:**
Motivated Master's student in Computer Science, specializing in Artificial Intelligence, seeking a Machine Learning Engineer Internship for the period of July 2024 to December 2024. Eager to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world projects and gain hands-on experience across the entire machine learning development pipeline.

**Accomplishments:**
- Completed Coursera Machine Learning Specialization
- Trained an ML model that takes as input the budget, keywords, and genre of a movie to produce as output the estimated revenue of the movie. Integrated this model into a web application.

**Work Experience:**
- Developed a software tool using Python and TestStand that allowed engineers to systematically test equipment used for production.
- Worked closely with factory agents to develop a comprehensive interactive report for data analysis using Power BI.

## Projects

### Project 1: Exploring Neural Networks
Comparing the results of a neural network built from scratch to a model obtained from transfer learning and fine-tuning.

### Project 2: Image Generation using DCGAN
Dataset of Pok√©mon from Kaggle, architectures explored from Kaggle source code and Radford et al. paper.

### Project 3: Movie Revenue Estimation
Machine learning model that estimates movie revenue based on genre, keywords, release date, and other features.
