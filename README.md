[Github Repository](https://github.com/PaulEm6/Movie-Revenue-Estimation)

This project aimed to predict movie revenue using machine learning, leveraging features like genre, keywords, and release date from TMDB. The main challenge was cleaning diverse data types. The pipeline included data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment. Future enhancements may involve advanced feature engineering and model exploration. Key takeaways included navigating diverse data and understanding revenue prediction complexities.

### Image Generation

[Github Repository](https://github.com/PaulEm6/Movie-Revenue-Estimation)

This project delves into image generation using a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) applied to the Pokemon dataset. Leveraging PyTorch, I enhanced a Kaggle-based source code, experimenting with neural network architectures to refine image quality. I also optimized the code for reproducibility by implementing object-oriented design and fixing a random seed. Future endeavors entail advancing image quality through exploration of cutting-edge techniques and architectures proposed in research papers for neural network-based image generation.

### Exploring Neural Networks

[Github Repository](https://github.com/PaulEm6/Exploring-Neural-Networks)

This project explores neural networks for image classification, comparing the efficacy of training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch versus utilizing transfer learning. Using a dataset of plantation images from Kaggle, including jute, corn, rice, wheat, and sugarcane, Keras is employed for model development and Scikit-learn for performance analysis. The study aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of each approach, with potential applications spanning agriculture, image classification, and machine learning research.
