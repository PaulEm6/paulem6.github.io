[Github Repository](https://github.com/IIanonymeII/8INF974_Atelier_pratique_AI_2)

This machine learning project consists of, firstly, a literature review of different scientific articles on the use of machine learning and predictive analysis in sports, and secondly, adapting the methods proposed in these articles to different datasets. For example, an article elaborating on how to use machine learning algorithms to predict football results was used to predict results in basketball. This project was done in collaboration with another student.
### Analytical Study of the European Football Championship

[Github Repository](https://github.com/PaulEm6/Euro-Data-Exploration_Seminaire-IA)

This data analysis project consists of a comprehensive study of the European Football Championship. The EURO Cup data is taken from a Kaggle dataset. We perform data exploration and visualize some interesting trends in the dataset. An essential part of the project involves verifying different hypotheses about the EURO Cup, such as whether the host nation has an advantage. Some statistical analysis and machine learning were performed during this project.
